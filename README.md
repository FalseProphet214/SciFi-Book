Creating this Repo for a book Project with Matt.</br>
</br>
Steps on how to add information to the Obsidian Vault</br>
</br>
1 - Download Git Hub Desktop and log into it</br>
2 - Clone the Repo by clicking the Code dropdown and selecting Open in GitHub Desktop</br>
3 - This *should* save the vault into your documents folder</br>
</br>
Steps on how to add a branch</br>
1 - In GitHub Desktop, click the Current Branch tab and select New branch</br>
2 - Provide the branch with a name. *Note: provide it with a simple name that briefly explains what you are adding*</br>
3 - One you have created that new branch, you can open the Obsidian Vault and start working on whatever you need. GitHub Desktop will Automatically detect changed to files within the Vault you are working in and will note them down</br>
4 - While working in the vault, if there is ever a time where you need to step away for a little bit, go into GitHub Desktop and click the Publish Branch button. This will push your changed to your branch in GitHub (*the website*) so that if you ever loose your work, you can pull the branch back down and get all your saved data again</br>
5 - Once you are done with all of your planned changes, Publish your branch one last time. You will see that the Publish button will become a Pull Request button</br>
6 - Once the pull request is completed, let me know and I will merge it into Main. This will merge all of our edits together.</br>
</br>
Pull Changes</br>
</br>
1 - Once I save and merge My branch, I will message you and let you know it is your turn</br>
      </br>---MAKE SURE OBSIDIAN IS CLOSED AND NOT RUNNING---</br></br>
2 - In Github Desktop, click on the Current Branch dropdown and change it to Main</br>
3 - In the Main Branch, you will now see a Pull Origin button next to the branch dropdown. Click this to pull all the changes that were merged into Main. this will Update all the Files/Folders in the Obsidian Vault</br>
4 - Once everything is pulled, open the Branch Dropdown again and create a new branch</br>
5 - Provide it with a unique name and create your branch and continue writing!</br>
